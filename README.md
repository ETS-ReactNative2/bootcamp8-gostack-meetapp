    MEETAPP challenger
</h1>


## A challenger for [RocketSeat GoStack Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/bootcamp) Certificate


## Concepts

- The application created is a event agregator for developers called Meetapp (acronymous for Meetup + App). It means that users will be able to create it owns meetups and also participate in meetups which were not created by the same user logged.
- The backend application its an API which will allow: create, update and authenticate users (using encryption for password); create, update and list meetups; create, update and list subscription in meetups; notify meetup onwers, via e-mail, about new subscriptions; upload meetup banner and user avatar
- By the the frontend and mobile applications will be possible the user sign up and manage it profile.
- By the front end and mobile applications will be possible the user sign up and manage it profile.
- Complementing the fuctionalities regarding to sign up / sign in, the front end and mobile applications has distinct utilizations:

  1) The frontend was developed only to allow users to create and manage meetups.
  2) The mobile application was built only to allow users to subscribe to meetups which they are not ornanizing.
